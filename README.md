## Requirements

## Description of the project

This project creates a simple astronomical catalog of star patterns such as constellations and asterisms.

- A star pattern is a constellation or a group of stars (IUA, 2024)
- A constellation is an official or defined star pattern (International Astronomical Union (IUA, 1930)
- An asterism is an unofficial sub-pattern within a constellation or unofficial pattern that overlaps constellations (IUA, 2024)

The project has SQL tables, a parent class, inherited classes, interfaces, services, controller, and repository testing.

## Setup

For this project, there are two implemented database tables. The database data represents true information for a simple astronomical catalog.

| pattern_id | name            | description          | discovery_period   | pattern_type  |   
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |  
| P1         | Aquila          | The eagle            | Ancient            | Constellation |
| P2         | Cygnus          | The swan             | Ancient            | Constellation |
| P3         | Lyra            | The lyre             | Ancient            | Constellation |
| P4         | Northern Cross  | The Northern Cross   | Middle Ages        | Asterism      |
| P5         | Summer Triangle | The Summer Triangle  | Modern Era         | Asterism      |
