# Starlit_One: An Astronomical Catalog Application

## Description of the project

This backend application project creates a simple astronomical catalog of star patterns such as constellations and asterisms.

- A star pattern is a constellation or a group of stars (IUA, 2024)
- A constellation is an official or defined star pattern (International Astronomical Union (IUA, 1930)
- An asterism is an unofficial sub-pattern within a constellation or unofficial pattern that overlaps constellations (IUA, 2024)

The project has SQL tables, a parent class, inherited classes, interfaces, services, controller, and repository testing. 

Some caveats:

Only spring and summer phenomena were considered for this project. These constellations and asterisms manifest in the northern hemisphere. These star patterns are disjoint to simplify table structuring.

## Setup

For this project, there are two implemented database tables. The database data represents true information for a simple astronomical catalog.

| id | name            | description          | discovery_period | pattern_type  | main_star_count |
